## Gareth Harris

I have over 10 years experience looking after internet and intranet sites at both large and small organisations.

The majority of my career was at BP, primarily looking after the internet and intranet sites of their aviation division. Over the years my duties expanded into areas such as business analysis, user support and training. 

After leaving BP, I spent a few months in Tokyo studying Japanese language. I enjoyed it so much I decided to start planning a longer trip. In the meantime, I contracted at NHS Health Education East of England for a few months helping them with the migration of their website to a new platform (Drupal 7).

Once the NHS contract ended, I headed back to Tokyo and ended up staying for a few years enrolled in a Japanese language course. While in Japan I had a few part time jobs; first as an assistant at an othodontic clinic (I helped create an English version of their website during quiet periods) and then doing web development and translation work at a company that supplies dental products.

My next role, after returning to the UK was as a Web Producer at digital publication company, Page Lizard. 

Family commitments resulted in me returning to Japan, followed by Vietnam until the beginning of this year. During this time I studied mobile app development using Dart and Flutter. I found this extremely enjoyable and it convinced me that upon my return the UK, a career change to focus more on development work would be a good idea.
