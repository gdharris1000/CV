## Gareth Harris


I have recently graduated from Makers Academy coding bootcamp and am seeking my first Junior Developer role. 

I have over 10 years of experience working in the fields of web management, business analysis, 1st line systems support and training. 

After experiencing the immence satisfaction of completing projects while learning mobile app development using Dart and Flutter, I decided to sign up for Makers Academy so I could make the transition into a more technical role.

## Skills

#### Web Developement

Over 10 years experience maintaining websites for an international audience. Primarily using content management systsems, but also HTML, CSS and Javascript when required. 
While studing at Makers Academy, I also gained further skills in Ruby on Rails and improved in my Javascript abilities.

#### Flutter / Dart
I have spent the last few months doing an online course on mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. 

#### Japanese Language (conversational level)

I am comfortable communicating in Japanese at a conversational level and have achieved level N3 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.
